# Introduction

`@awesome-elements/markdown` helps to display markdown contents with ease. Built on top of [marked](https://marked.js.org/).

## How to install

### Install with NPM

```bash
npm i https://github.com/awesome-elements/markdown.git
```

## How to import

### From HTML

To obtain it directly from the CDN, it can be imported by simply adding a `script` tag like this:

```html
<script type="module" src="<url>"></script>
```

If it is installed locally, then it can be imported by adding a `script` tag like this:

```html
<script type="module" src="<path>"></script>
```

### From JavaScript

Assuming it is installed locally by using NPM, then it can be imported like this:

```js
import "awesome-elements";
```

This `import` statement would define the custom elements automatically.
